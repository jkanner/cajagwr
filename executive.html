There is a refridgerator in the library kitchen next to the auditorium in Cahill.  The big shelf is marked "Seminar".  You can put the food there before the talk.

Food should be set-up on the table in the Cahill entranceway.  If possible, please set out the food during the talk.  I will try to end all seminars promptly at 5:00 pm.

<li> <b>For seminars in Cahill 370</b> Food will be in Cahill 319, the
